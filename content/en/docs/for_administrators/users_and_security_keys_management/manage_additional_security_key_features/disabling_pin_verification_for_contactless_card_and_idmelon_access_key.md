**Step 3:** If you have administrator rights on the device, you can set the policy in the **IDmelon Access Key**.
To do this, run the following command:

```cmd
accesskeycli set-pin-policy -p pin_prohibited
```

## Silent Installation of IDmelon Access Key with Set Policy

**Step 1:** Download the **IDmelon Access Key** (Version 2.5.0.2 or later) (also known as Card Reader Driver).

**Step 2:** To install the access key with a required PIN, use the command:

```cmd
installer.exe /S set-pin-policy -p pin_required
```

To install with a prohibited PIN, use the command:

```cmd
installer.exe /S set-pin-policy -p pin_prohibited
```

---

**Important Note:** For optimal functionality, ensure the contactless card is set to **PINless** while the access key is set to **prohibited**. A contactless card configured for PIN verification will not function with an Access key that is set to **prohibited** and vice versa.
